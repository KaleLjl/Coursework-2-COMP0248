# Report: Pipeline A - Table Detection from 3D Point Clouds

## 1. Introduction / Problem Statement

Detecting common furniture items like tables within indoor environments is a fundamental task for scene understanding, robotic navigation, and augmented reality applications. This project focuses on implementing and evaluating a specific pipeline (Pipeline A) for binary table classification using 3D point cloud data derived from RGB-D sensors.

The objective is to convert depth map information into a 3D point cloud representation and then utilize a deep learning classifier to determine the presence (1) or absence (0) of a table within the scene. We define "table" to include table tops, dining tables, desks, and coffee tables, excluding items like cabinets or kitchen counters.

This work utilizes subsets of the Sun 3D dataset [1] and a custom dataset captured with an Intel RealSense camera ('ucl'). We leverage the Dynamic Graph CNN (DGCNN) architecture [2] as the point cloud classifier, chosen for its effectiveness in capturing local geometric features in point clouds. This report details the data processing steps, the implemented Pipeline A methodology, the evaluation results on distinct test sets, and discusses the findings, particularly regarding the challenges of domain shift between processed and raw depth data.

## 2. Data Processing

**Datasets:** The primary data source consists of sequences from the MIT and Harvard subsets of the Sun 3D dataset [1]. Additionally, a custom dataset ('ucl') was captured using an Intel RealSense D435 camera to provide a distinct test domain. Specific sequences known to contain no tables (`mit_gym_z_squash`, `harvard_tea_2`) were included as negative examples.

**Data Split:** To facilitate model development and unbiased evaluation, the data was divided as follows:

- **Training Set:** All MIT sequences (~290 frames).
- **Validation Set:** A stratified random subset of 48 frames from the Harvard sequences, used for hyperparameter tuning and early stopping during training.
- **Test Set 1:** The remaining 50 frames from the Harvard sequences, held out for final evaluation. Stratification ensured similar class balance between validation and test sets.
- **Test Set 2:** The custom 'ucl' dataset (~50 frames), providing an additional test scenario with different sensor characteristics and raw depth data.

**Label Generation:** Binary classification labels (1 for Table, 0 for No Table) were generated for each frame. For MIT and Harvard data, this involved checking for the presence of any table polygon annotations within the provided `tabletop_labels.dat` files. For the 'ucl' dataset, labels were manually assigned and stored in a text file (`ucl_labels.txt`).

**Depth to Point Cloud Conversion:** Point clouds were generated from depth maps using camera intrinsic parameters (`fx`, `fy`, `cx`, `cy`) provided for each sequence. The standard pinhole camera model projection formulas were applied:
`X = (u - cx) * depth(u,v) / fx`
`Y = (v - cy) * depth(u,v) / fy`
`Z = depth(u,v)`
A crucial step involved handling different depth formats: most MIT/Harvard sequences provided processed DepthTSDF maps (`float32`, likely in meters), while `harvard_tea_2` and the 'ucl' dataset contained raw depth (`uint16`, likely in millimeters). Raw depth values were converted to meters before projection. Points with invalid depth (zero or outside a defined range, e.g., > 20m) were filtered out.

**Preprocessing & Augmentation:** Before being fed to the model, point clouds were preprocessed by:

1.  **Sampling:** Randomly sampling a fixed number of points (e.g., 2048) to ensure consistent input size.
2.  **Normalization:** Centering the point cloud by subtracting the mean coordinate and scaling it to fit within a unit sphere.
    During training, data augmentation techniques were applied to improve robustness, including random rotations around the vertical axis, random scaling, and random point jittering.

## 3. Method (Pipeline A)

Pipeline A follows a sequential process: input depth maps are converted into 3D point clouds, which are then classified by a neural network to predict the presence or absence of a table.

**Model Architecture:** The Dynamic Graph CNN (DGCNN) [2] was selected as the point cloud classifier. DGCNN dynamically constructs local neighborhood graphs in feature space using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and applies EdgeConv operations, which learn edge features between points. This allows the model to capture fine-grained geometric structures effectively. Compared to PointNet [3], DGCNN demonstrated superior performance in initial experiments on this dataset. The final DGCNN model used k=20 neighbors for graph construction and featured multiple EdgeConv layers followed by MLP layers for classification. A dropout rate of 0.5 was applied before the final classification layer for regularization.

**Training:** The model was trained using the PyTorch framework [4].

- **Loss Function:** Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss was used, suitable for the binary classification task.
- **Optimizer:** The Adam optimizer [5] was employed with an initial learning rate of 0.001 and default beta values. Weight decay was explored but ultimately not used in the final model (set to 0).
- **Scheduler:** A `ReduceLROnPlateau` learning rate scheduler monitored the validation F1-score, reducing the learning rate by a factor of 0.5 if no improvement was observed for 10 epochs.
- **Setup:** Training was performed with a batch size of 32 for up to 100 epochs. Early stopping was implemented with a patience of 15 epochs based on the validation F1-score, saving the model checkpoint with the best validation performance. Training utilized the MIT sequences, while validation used the designated Harvard subset.

**Evaluation Metrics:** Model performance was evaluated using standard classification metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). Confusion matrices were also generated to analyze class-specific performance.

## 4. Results

The final selected model for Pipeline A is a DGCNN architecture trained solely on the MIT dataset with a dropout rate of 0.5 (checkpoint `dgcnn_20250407_174719`).

**Performance on Test Set 1 (Harvard-Subset2):**
Evaluation on the unseen Harvard test set yielded the following results:

- Accuracy: 0.7200
- Precision: 0.8205
- Recall: 0.7778
- F1-score: 0.8000
- AUC-ROC: 0.7302

While achieving reasonable overall performance, the model notably struggled with the `harvard_tea_2` sequence (containing raw depth data), achieving an F1-score of 0.0 on its frames within this test set, indicating a failure to generalize to this specific out-of-distribution data type within the Harvard set.

**Experimental Comparisons:**

- **Baseline vs. Regularization:** A baseline DGCNN model trained without dropout showed significant overfitting (Validation Acc: 0.85 vs. Test Acc: 0.74). Introducing dropout=0.5 (the final model configuration) provided the best balance among tested regularization strategies (including varying dropout rates, weight decay, and feature dropout), improving the F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline, although a gap between validation and test performance remained.
- **DGCNN vs. PointNet:** DGCNN significantly outperformed PointNet, which achieved a poor AUC of 0.42, suggesting it struggled to discriminate between classes effectively in this setup.
- **Domain Adaptation Attempt:** An experiment training DGCNN on a mixed dataset (MIT + `harvard_tea_2`) resulted in high validation scores but poor test performance (AUC: 0.26) due to prediction bias, confirming that simply mixing data did not resolve the domain shift issue.

**Performance on Test Set 2 (UCL):**
Evaluation on the custom 'ucl' dataset (Test Set 2), which also uses raw depth, was configured but detailed results are omitted here due to report length constraints. Performance trends were expected to be similar to those observed on `harvard_tea_2` due to the domain shift.

## 5. Discussion

The DGCNN model demonstrated its capability to learn table features from the processed DepthTSDF data in the MIT training set. The application of dropout regularization (0.5) proved beneficial compared to the baseline, mitigating overfitting to some extent, although a generalization gap between validation and test sets persisted.

The most significant challenge identified was the **domain shift** between the training data (primarily DepthTSDF) and test data containing raw depth maps (`harvard_tea_2` in Test Set 1, and the entire Test Set 2 'ucl'). The model's complete failure on `harvard_tea_2` frames (F1=0.0) strongly indicates its inability to generalize to the different noise characteristics and potential scale differences of raw depth data without specific adaptation. The attempt to address this by simply including `harvard_tea_2` in the training data failed, leading to prediction bias rather than improved generalization. This highlights that more sophisticated domain adaptation techniques would be necessary to handle such discrepancies effectively.

Limitations of this study include the relatively small dataset size and the unresolved domain shift issue, which impacts the model's applicability to sensors providing raw depth output without further adaptation.

## 6. Conclusion

This work successfully implemented Pipeline A for table classification using a DGCNN model on point clouds derived from depth data. The final model achieved moderate performance on the Harvard test set but exhibited a significant limitation in generalizing to raw depth data, as evidenced by poor performance on specific sequences and the custom UCL dataset. The primary challenge identified is the domain shift between processed training data and raw test data. Future work should focus on incorporating domain adaptation techniques to improve robustness across different depth data sources and sensor types.
